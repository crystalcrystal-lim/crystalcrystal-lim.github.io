        <h3>Encountering a simple problem</h3>
        <p>
            An incredibly simple problem that I got stuck on was the testing primer in the reflection. I spent hours trying to infer the information given in the description, but ultimately I had no idea what to do.<br><br>

            This experience demonstrated my wildly unrefined problem solving skills. Consumed with frustration I spent a chunk of time away from the computer. This was a major hinder in my drive to move forward in the sprint. At that stage I felt I didn’t know how to google my problem, and didn’t have the courage to ask for help.<br><br>

            I eventually reached out on slack. I also found that the information I needed was given in the workshop tutorial video that I had accidentally missed out on watching. This INFERNAL experience thought me many lessons. The first being that I should have gone through the material in the correct order. Second, the feeling of overwhelming frustration is far worse than the slight embarrassment I may feel reaching out for help. And third, that the ability to google things and be able to know what I am searching for is a skill that needs to be developed and practised.

        <h3>Elegant problem solving</h3>
        <p>
            The JS Gradebook challenge on repl.it was a challenge where I felt my most graceful when problem solving. I used a combination of techniques. Similar to the rubber ducky method I verbalised my conundrum and talked to myself. I tried different approaches to the code. I googled terms that I wasn’t clear about and I reached out to my facilitator for help. After reaching out I was provided with a tutorial video to help me through Kata. I used this material as back up for when I was completely stuck on my own.

            In this particular stage I had to unpack what the task required of me, in this case what the use of the function addScore was. I was required to access Susan’s test score and add a new score.<br><br>

            To break down these steps I verbally explained the task: “Access the Susan object in the variable grade book. The step implies that there will be 3 arguments. Access the test score array and add a new score.”(Upon reflection pseudocode would have been very helpful in decluttering my brain in a more organised and effective method)

            I got stuck figuring out how to add a new item to the array. I used google to figure it out.

            The major contrast in my two experiences exhibit the importance of problem solving skills. I still don’t feel confident about Javascript. However trying different problem solving techniques and coming out with a little bit more understanding than I had before is extremely rewarding. <br><br>

            I learned that I can find the answer to almost any coding issue on google. It is just a matter of making it an automatic response when I get blocked, and refining my question asking ability.

        <h3>Problem solving techniques</h3>
        <p>
          Pseudocode - I have yet to fully use pseudocode and would like to utilise it much more in the future.
          <br><br>
          Trying something - I do often use this technique but it's mostly not very fruitful when not used in conjuction with other techniques.
          <br><br>
          Rubber ducky method - Classic! I have always found verbalising and explaining any type of problem helps me understand it better.
          <br><br>
          Reading error messages - I often find that I can't decipher the meaning of error messages.
          <br><br>
          Console.logging - Still doesn't come naturally however I recognise it's importance.
          <br><br>
          Googling - I'm getting better at it, this sprint has definitely highlighted the effectiveness of googling.
          <br><br>
          Asking your peers for help - I'm getting much more comfortable with asking my cohort for help, although I do try other problem solving skills first.
          <br><br>
          Asking coaches for help - As the sprints get more difficult I have been much more willing to ask my facilitator for help.
          <br><br>
          Improving your process with reflection - Reflecting is incredibly effective as it reinforces the information I have just learned.
