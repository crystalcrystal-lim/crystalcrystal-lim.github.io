        <div>
            <h3>Neuroplasticity and its benefits</h3>
            <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the brains ability to adapt, it can create new neural connections and strengthen them. Just like any muscle in the body it can be exercised and built stronger.<br><br>
                Possessing this understanding is beneficial as it validates the idea that there is equality in abilities. With practise, anyone is capable of learning. This comprehension encourages perseverance, consistency and confidence to strive for goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Engaging with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
            <p>Activity repetition and regular reviews will be beneficial for my own learning journey. Continued practise and failed attempts at Javascript will only strengthen the pathways in my brain. Reflection writing has also helped me track my learning progress and evaluate my thinking behaviour.</p>

            <h3>Growth mindset and relevancy</h3>
            <p>A growth mindset is a mindset that can be improved through practise. It views failures as opportunities to learn and celebrate the process! It is incredibly important as it impacts every aspect of life. With a growth mindset one is more likely to embrace challenges, whereas one with a fixed mindset is convinced that each individual has a fixed talent, making them more likely to go for the easier solutions.<br><br>
                It is especially relevant in my pursuit of coding as I have entered into a completely new field. The mindset that I have throughout the journey will and has established my level of success.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Surprises during this exploration</h3>
            <p>I reflected on this before my foundations journey. This is what I recorded back then:<br>
                I found myself reflecting on my learning behaviour and tracking back in time to the teachers I had in my life that implicated fixed mindset traits. It was a confrontational feeling when I realised I had brought the need for validation into my adulthood. This realisation however makes me want to grow out of a fixed mindset as quickly as possible.<br><br>
                
                Fast forward to my current position, and it is remarkable how many skills I have gained over the past three weeks. Throughout my entire life I have always hesitated with using computers and always found hands-on alternatives, convinced that I was naturally crap at operating computers. In fact I have always avoided things I believe or was made to believe I wasnâ€™t good at. My accomplishments so far at Dev is utter proof that the brain can learn anything! Repetition of activities and a positive open attitude has gotten me to where I am now. It can also get me to where I want to be if I continue to embrace the journey with a growth mindset.</p>

            <h3>Intergration of a growth mindset in my learning journey</h3>
            <p>I am at a stage where the learning content is becoming increasingly difficult and I can feel my fixed mindset creeping back in. However if I step back and appreciate the amount of knowledge I have gained during the past three weeks, I can envision how much more I can gain in the next two weeks. Consistently reflecting on my progress and celebrating my growth is vital to keep me going.<br><br>
                There is nothing quite like that dopamine hit when a piece of code is correct. However, I must remind myself to view mistakes and road blocks as learning opportunities that will eventuate to good code.<br><br>
                Continuing regular and honest reflections each day/each sprint/each end of sprint will help me to comprehend my own thinking patterns and will allow me to point out the aspects that I will need to alter.</p>
