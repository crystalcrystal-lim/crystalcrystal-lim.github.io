            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
            <p>In my final year as a fashion design student, my peers and I were designing and creating our graduate collections. I had taken a few years off from study before returning to complete my degree which meant I was placed with a new group of students who had been progressing through the course together and established strong friendships. A classmate had put together a mood board of imagery which predominately depicted indigenous people of China and cultural garments. I found it to be appropriation as it didn’t belong to this persons narrative and was disregarding the significant spiritual value to the members of that community and stripping it of the value in the name of fashion aesthetic.
            I was feeling trapped. The persons use of cultural appropriation did not sit right with me. As a person of Malaysian Chinese decent, I know the values of tradition that is deep set in cultural attire, and it collided with my value of respect for others. On the other hand I was a new comer to this group of people, it felt as if it could be a one against twenty type of situation, and I understood how sensitive the subject of creative exploration and having to showcase these ideas can be.
            I internalised this feeling for the rest of the presentations. I was concerned about the inappropriate work versus the feelings of the person who made the work, and my stance as a strange new comer that hadn’t established relationships and comfortable communication levels with my peers.
            I decided to approach the person a couple of days later when they were alone, and asked more about their decision to use indigenous people as inspiration for their work. I allowed them to speak first and explain their take on things, and weaved in my thoughts in a considerate matter. I was able to get my point across without coming off as if I was attacking the persons ideas. I noticed they expanded their ideas and imagery later on, but still kept some of the references they initially had.</p>

            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>I am a woman of Malaysian Chinese descent born and raised in Auckland. Forming my authentic identity was a crisis growing up. I didn’t connect completely with my white kiwi peers and often felt ostracised for looking different, eating different food, and having different traditions. I didn’t feel connected with my Malaysian Chinese roots either, I couldn’t relate to my parents traditional mindsets and clear communication was difficult due to language barriers. This misshapen culture of picking and choosing from my environment inside and outside of home has shaped the values I have today by running into many instances that truly tested what I valued most in my core.</p>

            <h3>Strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
            <p>My strengths are my reliability, my hard working tendencies, my ability to thoroughly evaluate my emotions, and my sociability. My limitations are underestimating my abilities, my anxiety, my fluctuating self-esteem, and my inability to make tough decisions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p>My persistent hard working nature and ability to understand my emotions will help me to eventually overcome obstacles that come in my way. When I hit a road block and can’t find a solution out, I tend to initially beat myself up about it. But when I take time to digest the scenario and essentially have a therapy session with myself in my mind, I can return and pursue ways to come to a resolution. My persistence doesn’t allow me to give up when I reach a difficult stage.</p>

            <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</h3>
            <p>At university there was a group project that made up of four individuals. Me and a fellow student took charge and assigned fair roles to each of the group members. I worked hard on my part, and completed the work with time to spare. However one of the group members didn’t pull their weight as we were reaching the due date. I felt frustrated as their lack of participation would reflect our whole teams work. I ended up carrying some of their weight to help us all get to the end result. If I were to be in a similar type of situation again I would take a different approach. Rather than taking over I would provide guidance and ideas and trust them to be able to apply themselves. It doesn’t help the other persons learning journey when tasks are done for them, and it isn’t healthy for myself to feel the need to be in control of every situation.</p>
