        <h1 class="title">Learning Plan</h1>
        <div>
            <p>I hope to remain in the fashion industry and work in the tech/digital sector. I would also like to freelance on the side and develop websites for local brands.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I would like to develop a growth mindset. I want to be able to view failures as opportunities to learn and embrace the process. I believe my current mindset is leaning closer towards a fixed mindset, I often get frustrated and avoid challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My strengths lie in my authenticity and my creativity. I am confident in my design aesthetic and stay true to it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am limited by my anxiety and my tendency to allow my emotions to take over. I am easily irritated and highly sensitive, and when I run into problems and challenges I find that I am overcome with negative emotions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Weekdays 8am - 4pm are dedicated to this programme</p>
            <br>
            <p>After a few honest attempts and thorough research on the internet, I will let go of my pride and reach out to my cohort and facilitators for help and guidance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>From my facilitation team, I expect open and relaxed communication. I want to feel safe and devoid of judgement when I approach the team with technical and emotional help.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is important for my mental health that I am staying active and social throughout the program. During the foundations program, my weekends and some weekdays after 4pm are times I block-out to go for walks, go to the beach, and socialise with friends.</p>
