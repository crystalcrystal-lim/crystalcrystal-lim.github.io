        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>The quality that enables us to understand and manage our emotions in positive ways.  Emotional Intelligence is to use emotional information to navigate our thinking and behaviour. It is fundamental for effective communication, empathy, stress relief, and conflict resolution.</p>
        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>IQ describes ones ability to use information and logic and apply it. It is meant to identify intelligence directly related to cognitive/academic thinking. It examines logic, maths and words.
            <br>
            IQ identifies highly capable people, whereas EQ identifies leaders and team-players.</p>
        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>EQ is important as it determines your everyday life. A quote that I found to ring true is, <em>"A high IQ will get you through school, a high EQ will get you through life.”</em>
            <br>
            In a work place environment an individual with a high IQ will be able to complete challenging tasks, however if the person lacks EQ they won’t be able to collaborate in team efforts, relate to co workers, or be a successful leader.
            <br>
            In everyday life, the individual with a low EQ won’t be able to express their emotions or understand other’s emotions. This results in a lack of authentic connection with oneself and the people around them.
