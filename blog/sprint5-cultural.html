            <h3>Three new things I have learned about yourself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h3>
            <ul class="font">
                <li>I am incredibly emotionally driven, and must continue to work on controlling my negative emotions</li>
                <li>I am feeling a very noticeable shift from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset</li>
                <li>I have shed my pride and embraced asking for help</li>

            <h3>The role of values, empathy and self awareness in programming and learning</h3>
            <p>
                As programmers share spaces and work in teams, the ability to have empathy and self awareness makes team work stronger and improves communication. Even in practice, when writing comments or pseudocode for other programmers, there is empathy required to encourage yourself to be as clear and understandable as possible. It is the act of putting yourself in the other persons position and understanding what it may feel like to receive incoherent code.
                <br><br>
                Personal values, empathy, and self awareness are important in a learning environment as well. Being able to respect each others boundaries and values by being in tune with how your behaviour is affecting others, makes for a learning space where everyone can feel safe. Feeling safe on a learning journey is the key to success as it is what makes you feel comfortable to ask questions, to interact with your peers, and to showcase your work.

            <h3>What has surprised me the most about the core learning</h3>
            <p>
                Honestly, the effectiveness of learning core skills alongside tech skills is what surprised me the most. I wasn’t skeptical about the process, but I didn’t think it would enhance my learning journey the way that it has. One of the most impactful core learning aspects was learning about neuroplasticity and mindsets. The knowledge that anyone has the capability to learn anything with practice, is what drove me to push through the moments when I felt dumb and useless. The process of recounting my past learning experiences to establish how and why I had developed a fixed mindset was  also an eye opening experience.

            <h3>The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h3>
            <p>
                I had always deemed myself as quite an emotionally intelligent person. However researching the subject was very confronting as I discovered I wasn’t as clever as I thought I was. I still struggle to take control of my emotions, but I have noticed through reflections that I am a lot less negative by sprint 5 than I was at the beginning.

            <h3>Why do I think a programming school is spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>
                Programming jobs are commonly team work based. The ability to be able to connect and communicate effectively with team members is vital. A brilliant coder can be terrible with connecting with others and lack empathy, which makes for a bad addition to a team. However an average coder, with bright human skills, can learn and elevate their skills on the job.

            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h3>
            <p>
                I don’t believe it has been a waste of time. As mentioned above it has allowed me to open my eyes to certain aspects of myself, where I shine and where I need improvement. These aspects are either advantages or hinderances to my learning journey.  If I think about all the tech information I have learned and practised over the five weeks, I don’t think I would be as calm and collected as I am now without regular reflections, and without knowing what my learning behaviour is truly like. In fact, I wish I had learned core skills sooner in my previous learning journeys.

        <h1 class="title">Preparing for Bootcamp</h1>

        <div>
            <h3>My long term goal andm career pathway</h3>
            <p>
                I want to remain in the fashion industry and work in the tech/digital sector. I would also like to freelance on the side and develop websites for local brands. I want to introduce overt exuberance into website design in opposition to the common modern minimalist design. To be able to achieve my long term goal, the skills I will need to gain are refined skills in HTML,CSS and Javascript.

            <h3>My biggest strengths and limitations in Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
                When evaluating my strengths and limitations in Sprint 2, I mentioned my strengths were my authenticity and creativity. My limitations were my anxiety and my tendency to allow my emotions to take over.
                <br><br>
                They remained the same after the course of foundations. However, during my journey I have learned skills to control my negativity. There is still more work to be done to destroy my limitations and I hope to continue to refine myself during bootcamp. An example of a way to refrain myself from getting into a negative mindset is simply asking for help. Often after spending too long on a challenge and feeling useless, it begins to hurt my self esteem and leaves me in a pit of negativity. Rather than dwelling in that head space, I can ask for guidance. The short moment of possible embarrassment I may feel from asking for help, doesn’t compare to the frustration and negativity it feels when feeling stuck. There is also mindfulness meditation and breathing exercises to help with my anxiety.

            <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp </h3>
            <p>
                I am concerned about keeping focused for the length of 9 weeks. I have found that to be a challenge already in foundations, and that is much shorter than bootcamp. The weight and speed of the course is something that drew me in, but also intimidates me.

            <h3>Human skills I would like to develop at EDA</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to develop my emotional intelligence. In particular my self-management and self-awareness. The way in which I manage my impulsive feelings and emotions in a healthy way, and the ability to recognise my emotions and how they affect my thoughts and behaviour.
            </p>

            <h3>Expectations of myself on Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
                I expect to be at Bootcamp every morning on time. After a few honest attempts, and trialling different problem solving techniques, I will ask for help from other learners providing it is an appropriate time to do so, and from my facilitators. While on bootcamp I will dedicate everything to the tasks at hand. I will stay off my phone to avoid distractions.
